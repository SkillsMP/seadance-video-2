Searches for **Seedance 2.5 greybox**, “Seedance 3D blockout,” or the Chinese terms Seedance 白模 and 白模生成 Seedance usually describe the same production idea: use a simplified scene to communicate spatial structure before asking for a finished visual treatment.

ByteDance Seed’s official Seedance 2.5 materials describe white-model or clay-render control for camera movement, blocking, spatial relationships, and lighting. The result is not a literal texture transfer. It is a way to give the model a stronger structural reference.

## What a greybox or white-model reference is

A greybox is a simplified 3D or rendered scene with minimal materials. It can show:

- where the characters or objects stand;
- the camera position and path;
- the scale and shape of the environment;
- the order of actions;
- the relationship between foreground and background;
- the intended blocking and composition.

A white-model or clay render keeps the scene visually simple so the structure is easier to read. It does not replace an approved art direction, final asset, or rights-cleared reference.

## Why blockout-to-video is useful

A text-only prompt can describe a camera move, but it may leave spatial relationships ambiguous. A greybox gives the model a visual scaffold for:

1. composition;
2. character pose;
3. object placement;
4. camera angle;
5. motion path;
6. lighting direction and shadow behavior.

This is especially useful for previsualization, product staging, advertising shots, animation planning, and complex multi-subject scenes.

## A practical Seedance 2.5 greybox workflow

### 1. Build the simplest valid blockout

Use primitive geometry, clear silhouettes, a readable floor plane, and a camera path. Remove decorative detail that does not affect the shot.

### 2. Define the invariant

Write what the output must preserve: subject positions, camera move, action timing, object scale, framing, or ending pose.

### 3. Add visual intent

Describe the target material, lighting, color, environment, and mood separately from the blockout. Explain what the greybox controls and what the text changes.

### 4. Label references

If the provider supports reference labels, identify the greybox, character image, product image, style reference, video, or audio. Avoid telling the model to “use everything” without roles.

### 5. Test one shot

Start with a short clip and a small number of elements. Inspect camera, pose, occlusion, contact, light direction, and transition.

### 6. Iterate one variable

Change the prompt, blockout, camera, reference, lighting, or action one at a time. Keep the last stable version as your baseline.

## Prompt structure

A useful blockout prompt can follow this order:

> Use the greybox for camera path, framing, subject positions, and motion blocking. Preserve the relative placement of the main subject and the prop. Replace the untextured geometry with a rain-wet industrial set, physically consistent shadows, cool overhead light, and warm practical lights. From 0–5s, the camera tracks left as the subject reaches for the prop. From 5–10s, the camera moves behind the subject and ends on a wide composition. Keep the blocking and final pose unchanged.

The exact syntax depends on the provider. The concept is stable: assign a role to the reference and a separate role to the prompt.

## Common failure modes

### The output changes the blocking

The prompt may contain conflicting camera or action directions. Reduce the number of simultaneous instructions and state the spatial invariant again.

### Lighting ignores the blockout

A greybox provides geometry, not a guaranteed final light. Describe source direction, color temperature, intensity, shadow softness, and material response.

### Characters drift

Use fewer characters, clearer silhouettes, stable identity references, and simpler motion. Complex interactions should be split into shorter shots when needed.

### The result looks like a game preview

A blockout is a control reference, not a final style. Add the target materials, lens feel, environment, animation quality, and finishing requirements after the spatial structure is stable.

### The provider does not expose the feature

Seedance 2.5 greybox or clay-render control may not appear in every consumer app, API, region, or plan. Check the actual model documentation before designing the pipeline around it.

## Where greybox fits in a production pipeline

Use blockout-to-video for:

- storyboards and previsualization;
- camera and staging approval;
- product or automotive concept shots;
- VFX and environment planning;
- education and industrial demonstrations;
- early client review.

After approval, the team can move to a final generated shot, live-action production, animation, or a hybrid workflow. Keep the blockout, prompt, provider, model, and output together for traceability.

## FAQ

### What does Seedance white model mean?

It usually means a simplified, untextured reference that communicates geometry, pose, camera, and spatial structure. It is often called a clay render or greybox.

### Can Seedance turn a 3D blockout into a finished video?

A supported Seedance 2.5 workflow can use a blockout or clay-render reference to guide generation, but the exact input type and result depend on the provider.

### Is there a Seedance 2.5 rendering plugin?

A search result or community plugin is not automatically official. Verify publisher, permissions, model support, and API or app documentation before installing.

### Can I use a greybox for a commercial video?

You still need rights for every reference and must check the provider plan and output terms. A greybox does not remove licensing or likeness obligations.

### Why is my white-model video unstable?

Simplify the camera and action, clarify which elements must remain, use fewer references, and test a shorter shot before adding detail.
