If you are searching for **Seedance 2.0 4K**, **Seedance 2.0 1080p**, or **Seedance 2.0 720p**, start with the output setting—not the prompt. Writing “4K cinematic” in a prompt expresses a visual preference, but it does not change the pixels returned by the selected model endpoint.

The current provider documentation is the source of truth. It can expose different resolution choices for enhanced Seedance 2.0, Seedance 2.0 Fast, and Seedance 2.0 Mini.

## Quick answer

Current BytePlus video-generation documentation lists enhanced Seedance 2.0 output options that include 480p, 720p, 1080p, and 4K. The same documentation indicates that Fast and Mini tiers can have lower ceilings, including no 1080p option in the documented basic variants. Provider interfaces and regional products can change, so check the live model selector before you plan a delivery.

That distinction explains why a search for “Dreamina Seedance 2.0 720p,” “Seedance 2.0 4K free,” or “Seedance 2.0 1080p video API cost” can have several valid-looking answers.

## What 720p, 1080p, and 4K mean

- **720p** is commonly 1280×720 in a 16:9 landscape frame. It is useful for drafts, previews, and workflows where speed or cost matters.
- **1080p** is commonly 1920×1080 in 16:9. It gives product detail, faces, subtitles, and texture more room to survive compression.
- **4K UHD** is commonly 3840×2160 in 16:9. It provides room for cropping and large-screen delivery, but it can cost more and make generation artifacts more visible.

The aspect ratio changes the dimensions. A 9:16 1080p target is usually 1080×1920, not 1920×1080. If the platform offers native portrait output, select 9:16 before generation instead of cropping a landscape clip after the fact.

## Resolution does not equal quality

A 4K file can still have unstable hands, drifting faces, broken text, or inconsistent products. Resolution controls the frame size; it does not fix motion, prompt adherence, temporal consistency, bitrate, or audio sync.

Use 720p to block a scene when the goal is to test:

- the camera path;
- the subject and action;
- the reference image or video;
- the timing and ending frame;
- the presence of unwanted text or objects.

Once the shot works, move to 1080p or 4K only if the publishing requirement justifies the extra cost and render time.

## How to verify Seedance 2.0 1080p or 4K

### 1. Confirm the exact tier

Check whether the selector says enhanced Seedance 2.0, Fast, Mini, or another provider-specific model. Do not transfer the resolution list from one tier to another.

### 2. Select the output setting

Choose 720p, 1080p, or 4K in the interface or API parameter when that option is explicitly present. A prompt cannot force a resolution that the endpoint does not expose.

### 3. Run a small test

Use one subject, one action, a short duration, and a simple background. Keep the prompt, reference assets, model ID, and settings together.

### 4. Inspect the downloaded file

Check the actual width and height, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, audio, format, watermark, and playback. A file with 1280×720 metadata is a 720p output even if its filename says “1080p.”

The [current BytePlus video-generation reference](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplus_las/video_gen_enhanced) is a useful starting point for API-level limits and model-specific parameters.

## 4K and 1080p cost questions

A “Seedance 2.0 4K unlimited” or “Seedance 2.0 1080p unlimited” offer is not comparable without its provider, model, duration, input materials, queue, and plan conditions. Higher resolution can change the billing unit, and a reference video can change the calculation again.

Before you compare a Dreamina, Higgsfield, or API price, write down:

1. model and tier;
2. output duration;
3. resolution and aspect ratio;
4. audio setting;
5. whether an input video is included;
6. plan, region, and failed-task policy.

See [Seedance Pricing](/seedance-pricing) for the broader credit and subscription checklist.

## A practical delivery workflow

1. Write a shot brief with subject, action, camera, lighting, duration, and target aspect ratio.
2. Generate a short 720p draft if the provider offers it.
3. Fix motion, identity, framing, and audio before increasing resolution.
4. Render the approved shot at the required 1080p or 4K setting.
5. Inspect the middle and end of the clip, not only the opening frame.
6. Verify file metadata and rights before publishing.

This sequence is also useful when the prompt contains “4k free,” “4K cinematic,” or “1080p high quality.” The wording can guide the visual intent, but the setting and file metadata decide the deliverable.

## FAQ

### Is Seedance 2.0 4K free?

There is no universal free 4K entitlement. Provider plan, model, resolution, duration, and promotions determine the cost.

### Does Seedance 2.0 support 1080p?

The enhanced Seedance 2.0 documentation lists 1080p, but Fast, Mini, regional products, and reference modes can have different limits. Confirm the exact endpoint.

### Does Seedance 2.0 Fast support 1080p?

The current BytePlus documentation lists 1080p as unsupported for the documented Fast variant. Recheck the live provider docs because model versions can change.

### Can a prompt force 4K?

No. Use the resolution selector or API parameter when available, then verify the downloaded file.

### Which is better for a draft, 720p or 1080p?

720p is often the more efficient draft target. Use 1080p when the shot is stable and the delivery target needs Full HD.

### How long can Seedance 2.0 generate?

Duration depends on the model and provider. Confirm the current mode before assuming that the maximum duration is shared by standard, Fast, and Mini tiers.
