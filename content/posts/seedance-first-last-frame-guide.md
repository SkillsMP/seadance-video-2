Queries such as **Seedance first frame end frame**, “does Seedance support start and end frames,” and “Seedance has no keyframes on Higgsfield?” all point to the same workflow problem: how do you control where a generated shot begins and where it finishes?

The answer depends on the provider and mode. Some Seedance surfaces expose a first-frame input, a first-and-last-frame workflow, video extension, or an editing control. The model name alone does not tell you which control is visible in your account.

## First frame, last frame, and keyframe are different ideas

- A **first frame** anchors the opening composition or subject appearance.
- A **last frame** defines the desired ending state when the mode supports it.
- A **keyframe** usually describes a time-positioned control inside a sequence.
- A **reference video** provides motion, timing, or structure rather than only one still image.
- An **extension anchor** uses the ending of an existing clip to continue the story.

Do not assume that a first/last-frame feature is a full timeline editor. Read the provider’s current input schema and UI labels.

## When a first and last frame helps

A start/end-frame workflow is useful when you need to:

- move an object from a known opening pose to a known final pose;
- transition between two approved compositions;
- keep a product or character visible while the camera changes;
- plan a short action with a defined ending;
- create a clean handoff for a later extension or editor.

The model still has to invent the motion between the two states. If the start and end frames are too different, the generated path may be unstable or visually surprising.

## A practical first/last-frame workflow

### 1. Make the frames compatible

Use the same subject identity, aspect ratio, lighting direction, and approximate camera language. A portrait opening and a wide landscape ending create a harder transition than two related compositions.

### 2. Define the invariant

State what should remain stable: face, wardrobe, product geometry, location, camera height, or color palette.

### 3. Describe the bridge

Explain the action that connects the frames and when it happens. For example: the subject walks from the doorway to the table, the camera tracks behind, and the shot ends as the hand rests on the object.

### 4. Check the provider mode

Confirm whether the selected model accepts one first frame, both first and last frames, reference video, or an explicit extension. A different mode can have different duration, resolution, or audio limits.

### 5. Inspect the middle

The first and last frames may look correct while the middle has drifting hands, changing objects, broken physics, or a camera path that does not connect the compositions.

## Prompt template

> Use the first frame for the opening composition and the last frame for the final composition. Preserve the subject identity, wardrobe, product shape, and lighting direction. From 0–3s, the camera slowly moves right as the subject reaches for the object. From 3–6s, the subject turns and walks toward the final position. End with the framing and pose shown in the last frame. Keep the transition physically plausible and do not add extra people or text.

Adapt the wording to the provider’s syntax. If it uses labels such as @Image 1 or @Image 2, map each reference explicitly.

## First/last frames on provider platforms

A search may mention first and last frames on Higgsfield, CapCut, Dreamina, or another service. That does not prove a shared implementation. Check:

- which Seedance version is selected;
- whether the input is an image, video, or both;
- whether the last frame is a hard target or a soft reference;
- maximum duration and resolution;
- how credits are calculated;
- whether audio and editing are supported;
- whether the output can be extended.

The [Seedance reference-to-video guide](/seedance-2-5/reference-to-video) covers the broader role of image and video inputs.

## Common failure modes

### The end frame is ignored

The mode may treat it as a soft reference, or the start and end states may be too inconsistent. Simplify the action and make the compositions more compatible.

### The middle morphs

Large identity changes, fast camera movement, many subjects, and conflicting prompt directions can create an unstable bridge. Reduce the number of changes.

### The provider has no keyframe control

That may be a product limitation, not a model failure. Use a supported first/last-frame mode, reference video, extension, or a conventional editor for exact timing.

### The result has a watermark

Frame control does not determine watermark rights. Check the provider’s plan and export setting separately.

## Testing and QA

Run three versions:

1. first frame only;
2. first and last frames;
3. reference video or extension, if supported.

Keep the prompt and output settings identical where possible. Compare identity, motion, camera, timing, audio, output dimensions, and cost. This makes it clear whether the extra frame actually helps.

## FAQ

### Does Seedance support first and last frames?

Some Seedance 2.0 and 2.5 provider surfaces document first-frame and first/last-frame workflows. Check the exact model and mode before relying on it.

### Does Seedance have keyframes?

Not every provider exposes a timeline-style keyframe control. If you need exact intermediate timing, look for documented editing or use a video editor after generation.

### Why does Higgsfield say Seedance has no keyframes?

The platform may not expose a keyframe UI even if another provider has a start/end-frame or editing mode. Check the current product documentation and model selector.

### Can CapCut Seedance use a first and last frame?

It depends on the current CapCut product and account. Verify the visible controls and the selected model instead of transferring instructions from another platform.

### Can I extend a Seedance video from the last frame?

Some providers expose video extension or continuation. Use a stable ending frame, describe the next action, and confirm the current duration and credit rules.

### Can I use first and last frames for free without a watermark?

Trial and watermark rules are provider- and plan-specific. Check the export terms and the downloaded file.
